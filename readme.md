# Generative Art Gallery Canvas

Project started inspired by [FRAMED](https://frm.fm/) and the will to learn HTML/CSS/JS, Node.js, Express.js, Electron.js, TypeScript, SASS, p5.js, paper.js, THREE.js...
 
The goal is to have a Electron app that can load different generative art canvas, developed with Web technics (HTML/CSS/JS, WebGL, HTML Canvas, p5.js, THREE.js, Paper.js...).

The generative art could be started remotly from a list of available arts. Using a web app served by the Electron app. The app should also publish a REST Api for remote control.

Later I plane to build a remote app using Flutter.
And later again migrate REST API to GraphQL.
